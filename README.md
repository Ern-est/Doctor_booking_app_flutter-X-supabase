# ðŸ©º Doctor Booking App

A modern, full-stack **Doctor Booking App** built with **Flutter** and **Supabase** that supports **role-based authentication**, allowing users to sign up either as a **Doctor** or a **Patient**.

The app is designed to streamline the process of connecting patients with qualified doctors by enabling secure registration, role assignment, and a scalable backend to support future features like appointment scheduling, medical record sharing, and real-time messaging.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The goal of this app is to provide a foundational, scalable architecture for a real-world doctor booking system. It handles:

- âœ… **User Authentication** (Signup & Login)
- âœ… **Role Selection** (Doctor or Patient)
- âœ… **Secure Storage** of user data in Supabase
- âœ… **Clean UI/UX** following Flutter best practices
- âœ… **Modular Architecture** to support future enhancements like appointments, doctor availability, and chats

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **User signs up** with their full name, email, and password.
2. Upon successful registration, they are **redirected to a role selection screen**.
3. The user chooses between **Doctor** or **Patient**.
4. Their chosen role is then **stored in Supabase** along with their name and email.
5. You can then use this role data to navigate users to different home screens based on their role.
